<para>

The oasis-config Roll must be installed during the Frontend installation step
of your cluster (refer to section 1.2 of the Rocks usersguide).
Future releases will allow the installation of the oasis-config Roll onto a
running system.

The oasis-config Roll is added to a Frontend installation in exactly the same
manner as the required HPC Roll.  Specifically, after the HPC Roll is
added the installer will once again ask if you have a Roll (see
below).  Select 'Yes' and insert the oasis-config Roll.
